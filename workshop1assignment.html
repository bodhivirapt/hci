              This assignment required me to manipulate the practice sketch to include the generation of random colours to create a more interesting look to the skethch. From the original sketch, I added no stroke to create a cleaner look along with several variables which are assigned to random integers. The Screenshot of the assignment can be seen in the image above.

            After going through many different examples of the application of computer vision. I settled on tweaking around with the skeleton tracking. At first glanced it reminded me of spooky halloween type of skeleton. The tweak that I did was simple but was quite entertaining to try out. I added a black background to make it look dark and used a similar line of code to change the colour of the circles and stroke to make it random.

          When playing around with the distance, I thought what could be this used for? As an ammateur boxer, I immedietly thought of how it can be used to see how far I could punch. To do this, I left the white skeleton because it looks fun and also added a line between 2 points. These points are the x and y coordinate of the left and right wrist. Next, I mapped the colour of the circle and line to the distance of the "punches" so when a punch is further away the line turns pink. I had a lot of fun with this to say the least.
