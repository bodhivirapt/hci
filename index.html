            <h5> About me </h5>
          <br>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Bodhivira Tiomargo, a second year THUAS currently also a UX Design intern at Royal Philips in Eindhoven. The reason I joined UX was to be able to design products that have meaning behind them. I love working in multiple disciplines and experiemnt different ways of innovating. I would say that I have a basic understanding behind code and programming. Therefore, this would be a challenging and fun experience for me.

          <h5> My expectations </h5>
        <br>
          <p>
            My biggested expectations in this course would be to expand my horizon and get to learn different discipines which would contribute into my personal development as a UX Designer. I would expect to increase my knowledge in both theoritical aspects but also in practical aspects.
          </p>

        <h5> What I want to learn</h5>
      <br>
        <p>
          What I am most curious to learn would be arduino. I always have a fascintaion with physical objects compared to digital ones. I feel like they are more intersting to interact and engage more senses compared to digital.
