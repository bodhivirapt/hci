            While toying around with the different types of shapes available, I ended up with a small fun monochrome exhibition with different multsided shapes. What was a bit confusing to get used to was the placement because it was a bit difficult to understand at first.

          In this assignment, I contributed more time to playing around with the different type of way I could animate the block. I played around with the looping and also rotating all axis which made it look kinda cool.

        In this last one, I got a bit confused because I was not aware that I was suppose to be looking at it for quite some time. But eventually I go the hang of it and just played around with making it further away with room to grow bigger.
