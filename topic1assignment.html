    <h5> Interactive Play - The Cigarette Bud Problem </h5>
  <br>
    <p>
      Although the target is the main hall of the campus, I decided to expand the radius slightly to right outside the campus where so many people can be seen to smoke. As anyone going to campus might might notice that the ground near the entrance where people smoke are often littered with cigarette buds. The goal would be to add a trashcan that doubles as somewhat a game of Tetris as well. When a person drops their cigarette bud, a block of Tetris will drop in the display also as an indicator on how full the trashcan is.

    As you can see from the sketch, the type of play could be either single or multiple, since It is an open ended type of play which helps encourage the good behaviour of throwing their cigarette buds properly.

  The input from the machine requires a sensor which detects when the pedal is activated to trigger a Tetris block to fall into. The machine also measures the amount of trash inside using a sensor to see the level of trash inside. The output is the Tetris block that falls in the LED panel covering the trash can.
