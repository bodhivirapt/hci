    <h5> F-35 Gen 3 Head Mounted Display </h5>
    <br>
    <p>
      Although I am typically not an advocate for these military innovations. I cannot deny that this is one of the most exciting things I have seen online.
      <br>
      <br>
      Developed by Collins Aerospace the F-35 Gen 3 HMDS costing a whooping $400,000 per helmet is a new generation fighter pilot head mounted display which is custom made for each pilot which helps to increase a pilots situational awareness, accuracy and safety.

      Unlike VR goggles that easily fatigue the users eyes, these goggles are designed to decrease it’s users fatigue by providing a less intrusive and high definition OLED display using projection technology integrated to the eye glasses.

    This is an example of Augmented Reality where the glasses itself does not block the users outside world vision but instead superimposes images into the real world.

      The Floreo website sums up what they do quite nicely, they are a virtual reality platform for learners with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, Anxiety and other individuals who can benefit from experiencing social and behavioural and life skills scenarios is a safe environment.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Floreo works by exposing their users in a stimulating environment which maybe a trigger for their users. The more they are exposed and the more they feel comfortable in a certain situation, this helps the users to gradually feel more and more confident about their actions in real life.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although the technology might be more simple since it only revolves around a world inside of VR. It may be challenging for these companies to create tailored experiences for their users. Also how to make these situations realistic enough.

        Using mixed reality, Arizo a company that focuses on 3D and AR instructor aims in helping big companies scale their solution by making training and insturctions easiser and more intuitive. One of Arizo’s solutions which include step by step pre-prepared instructions which enables companies to optimise solutions, reduce human error and increase safety.
        <br>
        <br>
        These insturctions appear in different ways. This include, text, visuals and even automatic or on demand videos that guides the user on each step. Besides instructions, these goggles can also be used to send a live feed to an expert for live instructions. These goggles make use of QR codes which become anchor points in the physical object and superimpose visuals through projection technology so the users are able to see the instructions in the screen.
