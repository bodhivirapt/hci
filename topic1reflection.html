            <h5> What did you think of this topic? </h5>
          <br>
            <p>
              I am really interested in how playful interactions can influence a day to day activities of people interacting with it. Although, I could also see how this type of interactions especially in public could be a source of irritation. Therefore, I think there are should be multiple considerations in mind when implementing playful interactions. Examples of these considerations are:
              <br> <br>
              <li>
              Interactions should not disturb people using it on a day to day basis
              </li>
              <li>
              Interactions should be designed thoroughly to prevent user frustration
              </li>
              <li>
              Some interactions are meant to be more utilitarian and not playful
             </li>


          <br>
          <br>
          <h5> How do you see applications and the future of this? </h5>
        <br>
          <p>
            In an ironic twist, playful interactions could be used to reduce stimulants in people on a day to day basis. People playing their phones while waiting on the elevator could instead interact in a playful experience which does not require being mentally overloaded by everything on their mobile devices. Besides that, i think playful interactions may also be a great gateway for people with mental disabilities to adapt into norm social behaviours.

        <h5> Did the subject meet your expectations? </h5>
      <br>
        <p>
          Yes and no. Although play as seen in the examples could be seen to help improve social behaviour. I think it could be explored deepeer into how it could be used to help people with disabilites and also design to be more inclusive. For example the piano stairs, these interactions could only be used by people who are able to climb stairs. I think it would be nice to also capture how playful interactions can be used to help instead of just “fun”.
