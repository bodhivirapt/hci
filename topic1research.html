            <h5> Description of interaction </h5>
          <br>
            <p>
              From the visuals shown above, the playful interaction that I wanted to showcase is a work by the I/O Design team which aims to submerge the user in an interactive digital ecosystem environment. Interactions include moving logs to create water streams, planing seeds and attracting animals from different ecosystems. This installation was installed in the New York Hall of Science with the hopes of educating and stimulating children to increase their awareness about the natural environment.

          <h5> Desciption of technology used </h5>
        <br>
          <p>
            In regard to technology, the input method used for this interactive experience are infrared cameras that are used to detect and analyse movement and interactions. More details of the input methods are not disclosed even after further research. As for the output method, they make use of a collection of audio visuals through projectors and speakers in order to create a stimulating and immersive player experience.

        <h5> Indicate and explain the type of play</h5>
      <br>
        <p>
          The type of play that can be observed is that it is unstructured and open ended. It allows mutliple people to interact or singe player as well. It can be considered more cooperative than competitive as players can colaborate to reach positive outcomes. It makes use of independent actions in a shared space where players can affect each others interaction.
