            <p>
              As the growing trend of Meta and more and more technological advancement in fields of healthcare through XR, I believe that this topic for sure is something the 21st century designer needs to be friendly with. I personally have worked in this field for 2 years now and it still surprises me about the new applications of XR in real world.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the future, we are talking I can see how XR can lessen the gap through the digital universe. Even now, there are factory workers working remotely being able to perform their job from vast distances. The next step would be remote healthcare, professionals in their fields do not need to travel to remote places in the world to be able to deliver treatment.

              Yes, the subject did meet my expectation, one of the important topics that I think was covered was learning about how extensive XR can be. When people hear XR or VR they immediately think of visuals. But we have not crossed over, smell, taste and other human senses.. Maybe even a 6th sense?
